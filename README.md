Embark on a journey through the cutting-edge realm of Farmers Point! 🌱🌐 In this comprehensive project demo,
I showcase the prowess of 9 meticulously crafted TensorFlow models, each dedicated to detecting diseases in specific plant varieties.
The fusion of Kotlin and TensorFlow Lite empowers our Android application, ensuring seamless, on-the-go disease identification.
Meanwhile, the web experience, constructed with HTML, CSS, JS, and Flask, offers an immersive exploration of plant health.
📲🌿 Explore the convergence of agriculture and technology as we unveil the intricate details of our project. 
This isn't just an app; it's a holistic approach to revolutionizing farming practices. 
From TensorFlow .h5 models enhancing our website's capabilities to the efficient deployment of TensorFlow Lite in the mobile app,
we're reshaping the future of precision agriculture.
